What Is My Purpose?

A. To find out who(ADULT or CHILDHREN) did most purchase or no purchase at all in the ice cream sales.

How Did I Do This?

A. In any hypothesis testing the process flows in a true or false manner. we all know that @ proportion test  test is performed when we have 2 discrete inputs and if we want to find a output which is Discrete too. So, at first I tried to convert each respective column into an individual array and verified if the data followed normal distribtuion. Now we check the means of the indivudal employee through the proportions_ztest function to find out which has the highest value to make a decision.
